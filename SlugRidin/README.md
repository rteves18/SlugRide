Code:
Well documented Code. There are 5 Activities to be aware of:

MainActivity.Java - the first page of the app. User determines if they want to be a rider or a driver. From here they are redirected to their respective activities. 

StarterApplication.Java - sets up Parse with our application ID and our server.

YourLocation.Java - This activity is for RIDERS! Once the app has determined you are a rider you are redirected to this page. This is a Google Maps Activity that shows the user their location. From this page they are able to request and cancel an UBER.

ViewRequests.Java - This is the Activity for DRIVERS! This activity allows drivers to see a listview showing the closest rides. Drivers can click on the listview to see an individual ride which will take them to the ViewRiderLocation Activity.

ViewRiderLocation.Java - This is the activity where the drivers can see their location and their riders location on a map. If the locations are acceptable to the driver they can accept the ride which will open google maps and navigate them to their rider.
